    <h2>My favourite Overnight Oats recipes</h2>
    <p>If you’ve never had overnight oatmeal, they’re basically a no-cook method of making oatmeal. 
        So, instead of cooking oatmeal on the stovetop or in the microwave, you soak the raw oats with milk. 
        That soaking process allows the oats to absorb the liquid and soften them enough to eat uncooked. 
        You only need to let the oats soak and rest in the fridge for 2 hours. 
        But, it’s ideal if you soak it overnight…hence the name overnight oats! </p>

    <p>The next morning you have a ready-to-eat, delicious, creamy bowl or jar of “oatmeal.” 
        The consistency is like a porridge or pudding. It makes for an easy convenient breakfast that has a more dense 
        and creamy texture than warm oatmeal.</p>
        
    <p>Best of all, you reap all the healthy benefits of oats in a fun grab-and-go breakfast</p>
